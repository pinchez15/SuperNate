### 4. Update Work Experience (Use Cursor AI)

1. **Open your resume PDF in Cursor**
2. **Open** `lib/work-experiences.ts` in Cursor
3. **Use this prompt**:

```
I have a resume game template that needs to be updated with my work experience. 
Please read my resume and update the workExperiences array in lib/work-experiences.ts.

The current structure is:
export const workExperiences = [
  {
    company: "Company Name",
    title: "Job Title", 
    period: "Start Date - End Date",
    description: "Brief description of role and responsibilities",
    achievements: ["Achievement 1", "Achievement 2", "Achievement 3"]
  }
]

Please extract my work experience from my resume and format it to match this structure. 
Include 3-6 most relevant positions, focusing on recent roles and key achievements.
