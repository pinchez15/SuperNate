## üéØ Essential Customizations

### 1. Work Experience Data

#### Option A: Use Cursor AI (Recommended) ü§ñ

This is the easiest way to extract your work experience from your resume:

1. **Open your resume PDF in Cursor**
2. **Open the file** `lib/work-experiences.ts` in Cursor
3. **Use this prompt** in Cursor:

```
I have a resume game template that needs to be updated with my work experience. 
Please read my resume and update the workExperiences array in lib/work-experiences.ts.

The current structure is:
export const workExperiences = [
  {
    company: "Company Name",
    title: "Job Title", 
    period: "Start Date - End Date",
    description: "Brief description of role and responsibilities",
    achievements: ["Achievement 1", "Achievement 2", "Achievement 3"]
  }
]

Please extract my work experience from my resume and format it to match this structure. 
Include 3-6 most relevant positions, focusing on recent roles and key achievements.

For each position, include:
- Company name
- Job title
- Employment period (e.g., "Jan 2020 - Present")
- 2-3 sentence description of your role
- 3-5 key achievements with quantifiable results when possible

Make sure the achievements are specific and impactful (e.g., "Increased sales by 25%" rather than "Improved sales").
```

4. **Review and adjust** the generated content as needed

#### Option B: Manual Update

Edit `lib/work-experiences.ts` with your professional history:

```typescript
export const workExperiences = [
  {
    company: "Your Company Name",
    title: "Your Job Title",
    period: "Jan 2020 - Present",
    description: "Brief description of your role and responsibilities...",
    achievements: [
      "Key achievement 1",
      "Key achievement 2", 
      "Key achievement 3"
    ],
  },
  // Add more experiences...
]
```

**Tips:**
- Keep descriptions concise but impactful
- Highlight quantifiable achievements
- Order by relevance or chronology
- 3-6 experiences work best for gameplay

### 2. Images and Assets

Replace these key images in the `public/` folder:

| File | Purpose | Recommended Size |

| `NateHooray.png` | Victory celebration image | 300x300px |
| `Starfighter.png` | Player spaceship | 64x64px |
| `spaceship.png` | Alien spaceships | 64x64px |

**Company Logos:**

```typescript
// Example: Add LinkedIn link to the comms switch
<button
  onClick={() => {
    setCommsSwitch(!commsSwitch)
    analytics.capture('easter_egg_clicked', { type: 'comms_switch' })
    // Add your LinkedIn link
    window.open('https://linkedin.com/in/yourprofile', '_blank')
  }}
